This directory contains the drivers-only management system that filters and displays only users with `user_type = 'driver'`.

## Features

## Database Integration

### Driver Filtering
- **Automatic Filtering**: All queries filter by `user_type = 'driver'`
- **Route Model Binding**: Ensures only drivers can be accessed
- **Security**: 404 error if non-driver user is accessed via driver routes

### Driver-Specific Stats
```php
$stats = [
    'total' => User::where('user_type', 'driver')->count(),
    'active' => User::where('user_type', 'driver')->where('status', 'active')->count(),
    'inactive' => User::where('user_type', 'driver')->where('status', 'inactive')->count(),
    'suspended' => User::where('user_type', 'driver')->where('status', 'suspended')->count(),
];
```

## Backend Implementation

### DriversController
- **index()**: Paginated listing of drivers only
- **show()**: Display single driver (with driver validation)
- **edit()**: Show edit form for driver (with driver validation)
- **update()**: Update driver (ensures user_type remains 'driver')
- **destroy()**: Delete driver (with driver validation)

### Route Protection
```php
// Ensure the user is actually a driver
if ($driver->user_type !== 'driver') {
    abort(404, 'Driver not found');
}
```

### Routes
Driver-specific routes (no create/store as drivers are created via users):
- `GET /drivers` - Drivers index page
- `GET /drivers/{driver}` - Show driver
- `GET /drivers/{driver}/edit` - Edit driver form
- `PUT/PATCH /drivers/{driver}` - Update driver
- `DELETE /drivers/{driver}` - Delete driver

## UI/UX Features

### Driver-Specific Design
- **Truck Icons**: Driver-themed icons throughout the interface
- **Blue Color Scheme**: Driver avatars use blue background
- **Contact Integration**: Direct call and WhatsApp buttons
- **Emergency Info**: Highlighted blood group display
- **Location Display**: Address with map pin icon

### Enhanced Data Display
- **Driver Avatars**: Blue-themed profile pictures with initials
- **Contact Cards**: Phone and WhatsApp with action buttons
- **Blood Group Badges**: Red-themed medical information display
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded driver status badges
- **Location Info**: Truncated address with tooltip

### Quick Actions
- **Call Driver**: Direct phone call integration
- **WhatsApp**: Direct WhatsApp messaging
- **Edit Driver**: Quick access to driver editing
- **Delete Driver**: Secure driver deletion with confirmation

## Navigation Integration

### Sidebar Menu
- **Drivers Menu**: Separate menu item with UserCheck icon
- **Position**: Between Users and Products in navigation
- **Icon**: UserCheck icon to distinguish from general Users
- **Access**: Available to all authenticated users

### Breadcrumbs
- **Consistent Navigation**: Dashboard > Drivers > [Action]
- **Clear Context**: Always shows current location in driver management

## Sample Data

### Driver Users in UserSeeder
- **John Driver**: `driver@example.com` / `12345678`
- **Sarah Wilson**: `sarah.driver@example.com` / `12345678`
- **Mike Johnson**: `mike.driver@example.com` / `12345678`

All drivers have:
- Complete contact information (phone, WhatsApp)
- Blood group information
- Full addresses
- Active status
- Email verification

## Key Differences from Users Module

### Filtering
- **Users Module**: Shows all users regardless of type
- **Drivers Module**: Only shows users with `user_type = 'driver'`

### Interface
- **Users Module**: Generic user management interface
- **Drivers Module**: Driver-specific interface with truck icons and contact features

### Stats
- **Users Module**: Total users, active users, drivers, admins
- **Drivers Module**: Total drivers, active drivers, inactive drivers, suspended drivers

### Actions
- **Users Module**: Full CRUD operations including create
- **Drivers Module**: View, edit, delete (create via users module)
